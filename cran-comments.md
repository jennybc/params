## Downstream dependencies

- flowr: CRAN's version of flowr, installs and loads fine with this latest version 
of params.
- URL: http://sahilseth.github.io/params is the actual source and more stable. 
The website is hosted at github.com and sahilseth.com is just an alias.
Could I keep the url as http://sahilseth.github.io/params?
